# elm-community

Some `*-extra` packages that are fairly popular have come to live in `elm-community` over time. These existing packages are managed by the maintainer listed on those repos, but no new packages are added under the `elm-community` name.

See [`history.md`](history.md) for info on previous intentions of the `elm-community` name.
